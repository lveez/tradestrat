With the patch the only way to set the boxlocation is through binds in the config as you can't open the console.

## Changes

* Added ascension and shang boxes / perks.
* Fixed bug with box animation
* Tidied up code so could be used as patch
* Sped up start of game
* Added trade average hud
* SPH now calculates when you kill the last zombie, instead of at the start of the next round
